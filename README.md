## Steps
If you want to test it in development, first of all, install all the dependencies with the versions that specify the project, then you have to open the resgister / login  at Api folder and then open the project by middle of the script that appears in the package.json

## How it works?
- You can register and authenticate as in any other application, it will only be for a time given to the way the application was made, but you can enjoy the gifs and register again whenever you want.

- Once inside and with a registered user you can bookmark the gifs that you like the most and like them to carry out the event.
